# source_control_test
Tonight, I'm learning how to use source control from github.
It's like a google docs, where people access the same file, and make changes together in real time.

Difference is, the changes from person A, and person B may be conflicting to the script. The source control aims to be the middle man, having both A and B discuss amongst themselves to find the compromise with the changes, and get the same resulting codes.
